### Enable installing add-ons from unknown sources in Kodi

By default, Kodi only allows you to install addons from the official Kodi 
repository. Everything else is regarded an unknown source, even zip files on
the local file system.

This short how-to describes how you can configure Kodi to allow installing 
add-ons from unknown sources. It is very simple and done in just a few clicks. 

The images shown here are made on Kodi 19.4 using the default skin. Things 
might look a little different on your system, depending on the skin or 
operating system you use.

From the home screen click settings. Other skins may not have exactly the same 
button in the same place, but there should be a way to go to settings from the
home screen.

&nbsp;

![img select system](/assets//images/kodi-settings-select-system.png)

In the settings screen select system.

&nbsp;

![img enable unknown sources](/assets//images/kodi-system-enable-unknown-sources.png)

In system settings, select 'Add-ons' in the left menu and enable 'unknown 
sources'.

That's all. You can now return to the home screen and install any add-on.
